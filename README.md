# FraudDetection-PredictiveModel
FraudDetection-PredictiveModel
** SmartFraudDetector
A machine learning project for detecting fraudulent transactions using real-world-scale data (6M+ rows).

** Overview
This project is part of an ongoing internship focused on identifying fraudulent activity in large-scale financial datasets using predictive modeling. The solution uses machine learning models, advanced evaluation metrics, and infrastructure recommendations for deployment.

** Features
Preprocessing for large-scale transactional data

Handling class imbalance (fraud vs. non-fraud)

ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Model evaluation with Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall

Visualization of fraud patterns

Infrastructure plan for scalable deployment

** Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.8+

Libraries:

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

scikit-learn, XGBoost

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code

Deployment Ideas: Flask API + AWS EC2/S3 or Streamlit app

ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset consists of over 6 million transaction records with features including transaction type, amount, time, and fraud label.

Note: Due to data confidentiality, a synthetic sample dataset is used in this public repo.

** Results
Model	Precision	Recall	F1-Score	ROC-AUC
Logistic Regression	0.93	0.89	0.91	0.94
XGBoost	0.97	0.92	0.94	0.98

âš  Values are indicative â€” actual results may vary based on the dataset version and tuning.

-> Future Improvements
Add real-time streaming detection (Kafka + Spark)

Use deep learning (LSTM for sequential patterns)

Deploy as a secure web app
